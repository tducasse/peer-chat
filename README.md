# peer-chat

![weekend-project](https://the-weekend-project.vercel.app/api/svg)

This is a very minimal chat, just to try PeerJS (peer to peer communication using webrtc).

- open [chat.tducasse.com](chat.tducasse.com)
- wait for your Peer ID to appear (generated through the Peer Server Cloud Service)
- enter a Peer ID to connect to (someone else has to have done the two first steps)
- send some messages!

# Things that I'm looking forward to try later
- video chat one on one by streaming the video from one client to the other
- connect to more than one client
