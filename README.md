# peer-chat

This is a very minimal chat, just to try PeerJS (peer to peer communication using webrtc).

- open [chat.tducasse.com](chat.tducasse.com)
- wait for your Peer ID to appear (generated through the Peer Server Cloud Service)
- enter a Peer ID to connect to (someone else has to have done the two first steps)
- send some messages!
